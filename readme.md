# ISOMAP

ISOMAP is a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique that aims to preserve the intrinsic geometry of high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space. It is particularly useful for data with non-linear relationships or when dealing with manifold structures.

## Algorithm Overview

The ISOMAP algorithm follows these steps:

1. **Neighborhood Graph Construction**: Build a neighborhood graph by connecting each data point to its k nearest neighbors based on a distance metric such as Euclidean distance.

2. **Shortest Path Calculation**: Calculate the shortest path between all pairs of data points in the neighborhood graph using a graph traversal algorithm such as Dijkstra's algorithm.

3. **Distance Matrix Construction**: Based on the shortest path distances, construct a low-dimensional distance matrix that captures the pairwise distances between data points in the high-dimensional space.

4. **Embedding**: Apply classical multidimensional scaling (MDS) to the distance matrix to obtain a lower-dimensional representation of the data while preserving the pairwise distances as much as possible.

## Visualization of ISOMAP

To illustrate the ISOMAP algorithm, consider the following example with a two-dimensional dataset embedded in a curved manifold.

1. **Step 1: Neighborhood Graph Construction**: Each data point is connected to its k nearest neighbors, forming a neighborhood graph. In the visualization, the graph edges represent these connections.

2. **Step 2: Shortest Path Calculation**: The shortest path distances between all pairs of data points are calculated using graph traversal algorithms. In the visualization, the shortest path distances are shown as the lengths of the edges connecting the data points.

3. **Step 3: Distance Matrix Construction**: Based on the pairwise distances, a low-dimensional distance matrix is constructed. This matrix captures the similarities between data points in the high-dimensional space.

4. **Step 4: Embedding**: The low-dimensional representation of the data is obtained using classical multidimensional scaling (MDS). MDS positions the data points in the lower-dimensional space to preserve the pairwise distances as closely as possible. In the visualization, the embedded points represent the lower-dimensional representation of the original data.

The visualization demonstrates how ISOMAP preserves the underlying geometry of the data, capturing the curved manifold structure in the lower-dimensional space.
